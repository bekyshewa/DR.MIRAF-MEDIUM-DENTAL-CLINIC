<h1><b>What is a dental implant </b> </h1>
<b>what is a dental implantDental;</b> implants are small titanium screws that can be used to replace the root of a missing tooth. <br>
The implant is placed into the bone of either the upper or lower jaw. Once it has bonded with the bone, the dental implant <br>
 will be used to support a new replacement tooth.

Apart from that, dental implants can replace one or more missing teeth. <br> They replace natural teeth in their function and their look. <br>
 Implants are a well-recognized restorative option that has a long history of success.
<br>
In addition, implants preserve facial structure integrity and minimize inconveniences associated with tooth loss.

<h2><b><u>Is dental implant procedure painful ?</u></b></h2>
Implant surgery can cause trauma to the jaw and gums. Because the mouth will be anesthetized, there should not be any pain during surgery.
 <br>You may feel some pain as the local anesthetic effect wears away. <br>

Before going back home, the dentist will prescribe you some pain relief medication to manage discomfort at the site of the implant. <br> A single implant is usually more comfortable and causes less pain than multiple dental implants. <br>
 The majority of patients will feel pain for up to 10 days following the procedure. However, the pain usually resolves after a maximum of 10 days.

<br>

<br><b><u><h3>When do you need a dental implant ?</h3></u></b>
Implants are a good option for anyone who is missing one or more teeth because of decay, injury or dental disease. <br>
 Dental implants can be used in combination with a crown and dental bridges, to replace one or more missing teeth. <br>

Sometimes, patients older than 50 express concern about the possibility of not being able to fully enjoy the benefits of dental implants. <br>
 But, your health is more important than your age.

Dental implant treatment can improve your appearance, your ability to chew and <br> 
enjoy food, and protect your remaining teeth.

After a thorough evaluation of your medical and dental history, your dentist will determine <br>
 whether you are a candidate to receive dental implants.

 <br><b><u><h3>How long does a dental implant last ? </b></u></h3>
Dental bridges coupled with dental implants from our dental clinic in Bole, Addis Ababa have proven to last for over 14 years in 95% cases. <br>

For most of our patients, it is pretty sure that their implants will last a lifetime. <br>

Moreover, it is important to take care of your implant if you want it to last long. Daily plaque removal is your responsibility. <br>
This can be done by brushing and flossing all around the restored teeth.

How to care for implants properly will be explained <br>by your dentist or hygienist. For maintenance appointments, <br> visit our dental clinic in Addis Ababa at least once per year
